# Galaxy tools for Computational Chemistry

The start of something exciting!! Computational chemistry tools in Galaxy. 

- **[Source code](https://github.com/galaxycomputationalchemistry/galaxy-tools-compchem)** :books: :wrench:
  - If you'd like to contribute tools please do!
-  **[Tools live on Galaxy](https://cheminformatics.usegalaxy.eu/)** :rocket::star:
   - In collaboration with [Björn Grüning](https://github.com/bgruening) and the [Galaxy computational chemistry team](https://github.com/galaxycomputationalchemistry), these tools are available on [Galaxy Europe](https://cheminformatics.usegalaxy.eu/) under the Chemical Toolbox section.
