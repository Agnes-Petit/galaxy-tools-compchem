                       :-) GROMACS - gmx check, 2022 (-:

Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Working dir:  /home/aepetit/Documents/scripts/galaxy-tools-compchem/tools/gromacs/test-data
Command line:
  gmx check -c minim.gro -bonlo 0.2 -bonhi 0.8

Checking coordinate file minim.gro
94 atoms in file
coordinates found
box         found
velocities  absent

Checking for atoms closer than 0.8 and not between 0.2 and 0.8,
relative to sum of Van der Waals distance:

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx check uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.
